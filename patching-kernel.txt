This is how the openwrt files and patches are added into the
vanilla kernel, as of r15069.

* Copy in target/linux/generic-2.6/files/*
* Copy in target/linux/generic-2.6/files-2.6.28/*
* Copy in target/linux/brcm47xx/files-2.6.28/*
* Apply all patches from target/linux/generic-2.6/patches-2.6.28
  in numeric order
* Apply all patches from target/linux/brcm47xx/patches-2.6.28
  in numeric order

Build with 
    CROSS_COMPILE="mipsel-openwrt-linux-uclibc-"
    ARCH="mips"
    KBUILD_HAVE_NLS=no
    CONFIG_SHELL="/bin/bash"
    CC="mipsel-openwrt-linux-uclibc-gcc"

Build targets "oldconfig prepare scripts"
Then "make -C image compile"

Maybe this is the way to build a kernel image without attaching
the initramfs image yet?
