name: linux kernel headers
version: 2.6.23.16
url: http://www.kernel.org/

The way that programs in UNIX-style operating systems access
system resources is by calling kernel functions called "system
calls."  The Linux kernel has header files that define all of the
system calls exposed to userspace programs.

Userspace programs don't usually invoke system calls themselves.
Instead, they invoke system library functions (such as the ones
defined in the standard C library, which on GNU/Linux systems is
typically glibc or uClibc) that invoke system calls as needed to
accomplish their work.

This step installs all of the Linux kernel header files that the
C library needs.

The kernel source tree also includes a number of other, private,
header files -- these define data structures and functions that
are used only within the kernel itself, and are not intended to
be visible to userspace programs.  The Makefile target
"headers_install" installs only the public header files, not
these private internal headers.
