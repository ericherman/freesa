name: MPFR library
version: 2.3.1
project_url: http://www.mpfr.org/

MPFR is a library for arbitrary-precision floating-point
arithmetic.  It uses GMP internally, but provides any level of
precision (including very small precision) and provides the four
rounding modes from the IEEE 754-1985 standard.

Like GMP, MPFR is a new component in, or dependency of, the GNU
toolchain.  It has been needed by the Fortran GCC front-end for
some time, but starting with release 4.3.0 of GCC, MPFR is needed
for C as well.

If your system already has MPFR installed, this step can be
skipped.

[these are probably all defaults except maybe the configure
command, so they should probably be omitted altogether.]
