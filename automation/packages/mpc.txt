MPC is a C library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic on complex
numbers providing correct rounding.  It builds on the GMP and
MPFR libraries.

Like GMP and MPFR, MPC is a new component in, or dependency of,
the GNU toolchain.  I haven't been able to find any description
of what features of MPC are actually needed by the GNU toolchain,
but MPC is a hard build-time dependency of GCC.

If your system already has MPC installed, this step can be
skipped.

configure-commands:
 - ./configure --with-gmp=PARAM[GMP_PREFIX] --with-mpfr=PARAM[MPFR_PREFIX] 
   --prefix=PARAM[MPC_PREFIX]
