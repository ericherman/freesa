GMP, the GNU Multi-Precision arithmetic library, is a new
component in -- or perhaps it is more properly called a
dependency of -- the GNU toolchain.  It allows arithmetic
operations to be performed with levels of precision other than
the standard integer and floating-point types.  Applications can
use GMP to provide arithmetic with thousands or millions of
digits of precision if that's what they need.

GMP has been needed by the Fortran GCC front-end for some time,
but starting with release 4.3.0 of GCC it is needed for C (and
C++) as well.

If your system already has GMP installed, this step can be
skipped.
