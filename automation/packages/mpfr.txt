MPFR is a library for arbitrary-precision floating-point
arithmetic.  It stands for "Multiple-Precision Floating-point
Rounding," I think; but that's not really clear.  It uses GMP
internally, but provides any level of precision (including very
small precision) and provides the four rounding modes from the
IEEE 754-1985 standard.

Like GMP, MPFR is a new component in, or dependency of, the GNU
toolchain.  It has been needed by the Fortran GCC front-end for
some time, but starting with release 4.3.0 of GCC, MPFR is needed
for C and C++ as well.  GCC uses MPFR to pre-calculate the result
of some mathematic functions when those functions have constant
arguments, and produces the same results regardless of the math
library or floating point engine used on the runtime system.
This occurs in what is called the GCC "middle-end," which is kind
of a silly name since it's not an end.

If your system already has MPFR installed, this step can be
skipped.
