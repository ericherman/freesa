name: GNU binutils
version: 2.19

The GNU binary utilities are a collection of programs and
libraries that produce and operate on object files.  The primary
ones are +as+ (the assembler, which transforms assembly source
code into object code) and +ld+ (the linker, which combines
multiple object files into an executable program); but there are
a bunch of others including +addr2line+, +ar+, +c++filt+,
+gprof+, +nm+, +objcopy+, +objdump+, +ranlib+, +readelf+, +size+,
+strings+, and +strip+; and there are a couple of shared
libraries as well (+libbfd+ and +libopcodes+).  All of the
utility programs are documented in man pages and the binutils
info file.

You won't need to invoke any of these programs manually.  The
+gcc+ driver program calls +as+ and +ld+ as necessary to do its
work, and several of the other utility programs are used
internally during the build process of the rest of the toolchain
(and beyond).

The GNU binutils can be built as part of a cross-toolchain by
using the "sysroot" framework.  That framework isn't particularly
well-documented, but the important thing from our perspective is
that we need to specify the configure options +--with-sysroot+
and +--with-build-sysroot+ should be specified.
