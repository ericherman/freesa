The GNU binary utilities are a collection of programs and
libraries that produce and operate on object files.  The primary
ones are +as+ (the assembler, which transforms assembly source
code into object code) and +ld+ (the linker, which combines
multiple object files into an executable program); but there are
a bunch of others including +addr2line+, +ar+, +c++filt+,
+gprof+, +nm+, +objcopy+, +objdump+, +ranlib+, +readelf+, +size+,
+strings+, and +strip+; and there are a couple of shared
libraries as well (+libbfd+ and +libopcodes+).  All of the
utility programs are documented in man pages and the binutils
info file.

You won't need to invoke any of these programs manually.  The
+gcc+ driver program calls +as+ and +ld+ as necessary to do its
work, and several of the other utility programs are used
internally during the build process of the rest of the toolchain
(and beyond).
