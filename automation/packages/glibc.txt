STEP 3 glibc headers

Apply the patches: libgcc_eh, localedef_segfault, i586_chk, and
fixup_for_gcc43.  The first three are from CLFS; the last one corrects the
glibc build so it works with GCC 4.3 (and is already in glibc CVS).

After doing this build, get rid of the glibc-build directory but keep the
source directory around for now:  we will need it again a little later.

STEP 5 glibc (startup files)

If you kept around the source directory from step 3, just use it again
here.  If not, remember to apply the patches: libgcc_eh,
localedef_segfault, i586_chk, and fixup_for_gcc43.  

The build commands here just build the startup files we need.  We'll build
the rest of glibc after we build libgcc.

Again, when this step is complete, delete the glibc-build directory but
keep the source directory around.

STEP 7 glibc

Now we have a usable GCC, complete with libgcc, and we can build glibc at
last!  Use the same glibc source directory as before, or re-apply all the
patches that were used previously; but use a fresh glibc-build directory.
