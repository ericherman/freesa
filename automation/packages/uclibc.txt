name: uClibc
version: 0.9.29

uClibc is a small C library designed expressly for situations in
which glibc is too large.  That's the case when building tools
for a resource-constrained environment like the flash EPROM on
the WL-700gE.

In most cases, uClibc can be used instead of glibc without any
application code changes.

phase: startup files

The build commands here just build the startup files we need.
We'll build the rest of glibc after we build libgcc.

phase: full uclibc

Now we have a usable GCC, complete with libgcc, and we can build
uClibc at last!
