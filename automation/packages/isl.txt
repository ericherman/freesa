 - ISL_PREFIX: /usr/local

The project homepage describes isl as a library for manipulating
sets and relations of integer points bounded by linear
constraints.  The important thing for our purposes is that it is
required in order to enable the Graphite loop optimizations in
GCC.  It's also required for the CLooG library, and an older
version (which cannot be used by GCC) is bundled with CLooG.

If your system already has the correct version of isl installed,
this step can be skipped.

configure-commands:
 - ./configure --with-gmp=PARAM[GMP_PREFIX] --prefix=PARAM[PPL_PREFIX]
