name: Integer Set Library
version: "0.12.1"
project-url: http://www.kotnet.org/~skimo/isl/

configuration-defaults:
 - INSTALL_ISL: true
 - ISL_PREFIX: /usr/local

The project homepage describes ISL as a library for manipulating
sets and relations of integer points bounded by linear
constraints.  The important thing for our purposes is that it is
required in order to enable the Graphite loop optimizations in
GCC.  It's also required for the CLooG library, and version
0.11.1 of ISL is bundled with CLooG.

Using a version of ISL later than 0.11 requires instructing GCC
to skip the ISL version check, but apparently works properly.

If your system already has the correct version of ISL installed,
this step can be skipped.

configure-commands:
 - ./configure --with-gmp=PARAM[GMP_PREFIX] --prefix=PARAM[PPL_PREFIX]
