CLooG is the "Chunky LOOp Generator," another mathematics
library: it generates code for scanning Z-polyhedra.  This is
needed for the Graphite loop optimizations in GCC.  There are
various versions of CLooG that use different polyhedral
libraries; the standard version relies on ISL and bundles a
version of it.  The configuration parameters used here assumes
that there is a later version of ISL installed already that
should be used rather than the bundled version.

According to the GCC documentation, we also need to specify
--with-bits=gmp so that CLooG uses GMP internally.  However, this
is no longer accurate with CLooG 0.18.0; with that version,
configuration fails if that option is specified.

If your system already has the correct version of CLooG
installed, this step can be skipped.

configure-commands:
 - ./configure --with-gmp=system --with-gmp-prefix=PARAM[GMP_PREFIX]
   --with-isl=system --with-isl-prefix=PARAM[ISL_PREFIX] 
   --prefix=PARAM[PPL_PREFIX]
