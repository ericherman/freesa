CLooG is the "Chunky LOOp Generator," another mathematics
library: it generates code for scanning Z-polyhedra.  This is
needed for the Graphite loop optimizations in GCC.  There are
various versions of CLooG that use different polyhedral
libraries; the standard version relies on isl and bundles a
version of it.  Unfortunately GCC requires a later version of
isl, so we need to install that separately and then instruct
CLooG to use the pre-built one.

According to the GCC documentation, we also need to specify
--with-bits=gmp so that CLooG uses GMP internally.

If your system already has the correct version of CLooG
installed, this step can be skipped.
