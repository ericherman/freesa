The cross-toolchain section builds a standard sysroot-style
cross-toolchain, which is fine for normal purposes.  The programs
constructed with that toolchain will be set up to link against a
dynamic loader in the standard location (+/lib+), and the C
library we built there has a dynamic loader that expects
libraries to be in the standard locations (+/lib+ and
+/usr/lib+).  To bootstrap the freesa system, we need to build a
set of temporary programs and libraries that are self-contained
within the +/tools+ directory instead, because we want the
bootable system to be entirely self-contained within that
directory; that way, we can build the final system components
into their normal locations, +/lib+ and so on, without worrying
about clobbering any of the temporary programs and libraries we
built with the cross-toolchain.

Therefore, we need to build an alternative C library that is set
up to have a runtime search path of +/tools+.

[Set up configuration parameters so that the stuff is installed
under /tools instead of $SYSROOT this time]
