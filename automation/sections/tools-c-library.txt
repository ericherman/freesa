The cross-toolchain section builds a standard sysroot-style
cross-toolchain, which is fine for normal purposes.  The programs
constructed with that toolchain will be set up to link against a
dynamic loader in the standard location (/lib), and the C library
we built there has a dynamic loader that expects libraries to be
in the standard locations (/lib and /usr/lib).  To bootstrap the
freesa system, we need to build a set of temporary programs and
libraries that are self-contained within the /tools directory
instead.

Therefore, we need to build an alternative C library that is set
up to have a runtime search path of /tools.

[Set up configuration parameters so that the stuff is installed
under /tools instead of $SYSROOT]
