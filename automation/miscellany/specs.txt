full-name: Adjust specs for temporary tools

The point of this compiler is to build the temporary tools that
will allow us to build the final system entirely from source
code.  When we're using those tools to build the final system, we
want to do a native build of everything, including glibc, so we
want those tools to be independent of any filesystem locations
that will still be present in the final system.  In particular,
this includes +/lib+ and +/usr/lib+.

When the standard GNU toolchain builds an executable, it always
links it against the dynamic link library (which is something
like +/lib/ld-linux.so.2+ or +/lib/ld.so.1+).  That's normally
fine, but we want the temporary tool programs to be entirely
independent of +/lib+.  So we need to adjust our cross-toolchain
so that the programs it builds look in the +/lib+ directory under
the temporary tools location for their libraries.  Alternatively,
we could build all of our temporary tools as static executables,
so they would be self-contained and not need any shared libraries
at all; but that option isn't well-supported by glibc.
