When NFS-booting:

We should patch the kernel to get rid of:

b44: eth1: BUG!  Timeout waiting for bit 80000000 of register 428 to clear.

"tools" isn't really the root of the system, but we told the toolchain that
it was the sysroot.  What would probably be better is to build with
SYSROOT=$CLFS instead of SYSROOT=$CLFS/tools.

pushd $CLFS/tools/lib
ln *.* ../../lib


Build the "diag" module from openwrt.  Put that in the Freesa git, as well.

ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=${CLFS_TARGET}- KERNELDIR=${CLFS}/Build/linux make
 
As cross-tools for "C": build VIM, lzma
