After building a uclibc-based native toolchain on the freesa box,
we have to use that toolchain to build all of the stuff that will
wind up in flash (except for the kernel image and kernel modules,
which are built using the normal toolchain).

Create a user who will do all of the flash image construction. I
called it ssbl for "Second Stage Boot Loader."  This can be a
package user if you'd like, or a normal user.  In this file I'm
assuming the user is called "ssbl".

Start by copying /opt/uclibc/sysroot to the ssbl home directory.

Now configure busybox -- we need to build everything we need in
the ssbl image, but absolutely nothing else, because (I can't
reiterate this enough) we only have 1728mb for the kernel image
plus root filesystem.

Use busybox 1.12.2.

Set PATH to include /opt/uclibc/bin as its first element.

busybox can be configured with "make menuconfig" -- it is just
like the linux kernel and uclibc.

I turned off everything I could turn off, including even such
things as terse applet usage messages
